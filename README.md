# Traffic-Accident-Prediction

Leverage ML algorithms and s3, MongoDB, spark, AWS to predict Single-Vehicle Traffic Accident Severity.


# Goal
The final project of MSAN697 Distributed Data System. In this project we used ML algorithms and s3, MongoDB, spark, AWS to predict Single-Vehicle Traffic Accident Severity. The learning outcome of this project is to understand the application of spark ML, cloud data pipline construction and cost efficiency in big data implementation.

# Data

You can find the dataset on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tsiaras/uk-road-safety-accidents-and-vehicles), which has detailed information about annual traffic accidents across the UK collected by UK government.

# Deliverable

Check [code](./code.ipynb) notebook for all implementations.
